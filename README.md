# Multi Agent Trip planning system

The AI travel agent fulfills advanced reasoning techniques, including role-based prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, ReAct prompting, and feedback loops (further information can be found under project_starter.ipynb)

This repository implements a multi-agent travel planning system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
The system uses specialized agents — each with a defined role — to collaboratively generate complete travel plans including:

- destination research
- itinerary generation
- activity suggestions
- budget estimation
- multi-step reasoning and validation

It demonstrates how multiple LLM-driven agents can cooperate through structured workflows, tool-calling, and memory to solve real-world planning tasks.
